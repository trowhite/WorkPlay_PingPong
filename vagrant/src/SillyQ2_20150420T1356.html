        <h4>Here's how the silly modifiers will work:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tiny paddles: Instead of using regular paddles, play with the tiny paddles found in the garage.</li>
            <li>Large ball: Instead of using a regular ping pong ball, play instead with the large yellow ball.</li>
            <li>Weak Hand: Play with the paddle in your non-dominant hand</li>
            <li>Multi Ball: There are 2 balls in play. Both players serve each other at the same time (one player counts down from 3 and both try to serve at the same time). For this modifier, it is HIGHLY recommended that you have an observer, since it will be difficult to figure out who got the points. For communication purposes, it might be useful to play with one orange ball, and one white ball. Games are still to 21 with this modifier, but keep in mind you still must win by 2.</li>
            <li>Pinhole glasses: Provided in the garage are glasses with many pinholes in them. Wear these when playing your game. Please wash and wipe them off after your match to prevent spreading sickness through the office.</li>
            <li>Rolling Chair: Both players must remain seated in rolling chairs for the duration of play. You are allowed to touch the ground with your feet, but you must remain seated in the chair at all times. Please be careful not to roll into anything.</li>
            <li>Obstacles on table: For this mode, each player places 4 paddles on their respective sides of the table. Two paddles should be placed in the center of each half, and 2 on the center line. All equidistant from the center of your half of the table, all with handles pointed in. A diagram is available on the white board. The paddles are part of the table, and as such, any ball that bounces off of them is treated as if it bounced off of the table. Do not choose tiny paddles for the paddles to be placed on the table.</li>
        </ul>
